<p>
  If you have the data frame.From the data frame if you through out the name of the rows and name of the columns you can get back the matrix.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Let's say you have 32 rows and 10 columns ,so ultimatly what you have.... you have a matrix of 32 x 10. you can directly get all that after that you can do all the multiplication.

  hear you can show the example of <a href = 'https://github.com/heet7/Python-Numpy/blob/9ca4088b8168b435a121d2a430cab0d176fe7cc0/How%20numpy%20arrays%20and%20pandas%20are%20going%20to%20related%3F/numpy%20arrays%20and%20pandas%20related%20example.py'>relation between numpy arrays and pandas </a>
